# RenovationAdvisor FAQ

## About Our Service

### What is RenovationAdvisor?
RenovationAdvisor is a premium renovation management platform that connects homeowners with vetted contractors while providing project oversight, budget management, and quality assurance throughout your renovation journey. We handle the entire contractor matching process and provide dedicated project management to ensure your renovation is completed on time, on budget, and to your exact specifications.

### How is this different from finding contractors myself?
Unlike DIY contractor searches, we pre-vet all contractors through license verification, insurance checks, background screenings, and portfolio reviews. We manage the bidding process, provide ongoing project oversight, handle disputes, and ensure quality completion with our money-back guarantee. You get professional project management without the hassle of coordinating everything yourself.

### Who typically uses your service?
Our clients include busy professionals, first-time renovators, out-of-state property owners, and anyone wanting professional oversight of their renovation project. Many are tech executives, healthcare professionals, and entrepreneurs who value their time and want peace of mind that their renovation will be handled properly.

### Do you work on investment properties or just primary residences?
We work on all residential properties including primary residences, rental properties, vacation homes, and investment properties. Whether you live in the property or it's a rental, we provide the same level of professional oversight and quality assurance.

### What makes you different from general contractors?
We don't perform the actual construction work. Instead, we act as your advocate and project manager, overseeing the contractors you hire. This eliminates conflicts of interest and ensures someone is always looking out for your best interests throughout the project.

## Getting Started

### How do I start my renovation project with you?
Simply provide your contact information and one of our renovation advisors will reach out within 24 hours to discuss your project. We'll gather details about your project goals, budget, and timeline, then match you with 3-5 pre-vetted contractors within 48 hours.

### What information do I need to provide?
You'll need basic project details (type of renovation, scope of work), property address, budget range, timeline preferences, and 1-20 photos of your space. The more detailed information you provide, the better we can match you with contractors who specialize in your specific type of project.

### Can I submit multiple projects at once?
Yes, you can manage multiple projects simultaneously through our platform. Each project gets its own dedicated dashboard, contractor matching process, and project manager. We handle coordinating between different contractors if projects overlap.

### Do I need to be home for the initial consultation?
Not necessarily. We can arrange virtual consultations via video call, or contractors can visit when it's convenient for you. Many of our clients with busy schedules or those managing out-of-state properties successfully use virtual consultations for initial project discussions.

### How quickly can I get started once I submit my information?
Most contractor matches are completed within 48 hours of submission. Complex or highly specialized projects may take up to 72 hours. Once you select a contractor, work can typically begin within 1-2 weeks depending on permits and material availability.

## Pricing & Fees

### How much does your service cost?
Our fee is 3-5% of your total project cost, paid only after successful project completion. For projects under $100k, the fee is 5%. For projects over $100k, the fee is 3%. There are no upfront fees, monthly charges, or hidden costs.

### Are there any hidden fees?
Absolutely no hidden fees. Our percentage fee covers all platform services including contractor matching, project oversight, milestone management, dispute resolution, and our guarantee. The only time you pay additional fees is if you request services outside our standard offering.

### When do I pay your fee?
You pay our fee only after your project is successfully completed and you're satisfied with the results. We collect payment when you approve the final milestone and sign off on project completion.

### What if my project budget changes during construction?
Our fee adjusts proportionally to your final project cost. All change orders must be documented and approved by you before work begins. We help negotiate fair pricing for any additions to ensure you're getting value for changes.

### Is your fee negotiable for large projects?
For projects over $250,000, we offer volume discounts and can provide custom pricing. Our enterprise clients with multiple properties or ongoing renovation needs receive preferred pricing.

### Do I pay contractors directly or through you?
You have flexibility in payment method. We offer secure escrow services for added protection, where payments are held until milestones are completed. Alternatively, you can pay contractors directly if you prefer. Our escrow service is included at no additional cost.

### How does your fee compare to hiring a general contractor?
Most general contractors mark up subcontractor costs by 20-30% plus overhead. Our 3-5% fee often results in overall savings because we negotiate competitive pricing and prevent costly mistakes through proper oversight.

## Contractor Vetting

### How do you vet your contractors?
Every contractor undergoes a comprehensive 7-point verification process: license verification, insurance confirmation (minimum $1M liability), background checks, reference verification, portfolio review, on-site quality assessment, and customer review analysis. We maintain a minimum 4.0 star rating requirement.

### What licenses and insurance do contractors have?
All contractors maintain active state and local licenses, general liability insurance (minimum $1M), workers' compensation coverage, and bonds where required. We verify all documentation is current before any contractor enters our network.

### Can I see contractor reviews and past work?
Yes, you'll receive detailed profiles including photo portfolios, customer reviews, completed project examples, and specialty certifications for each matched contractor. We also provide references you can contact directly.

### What if I don't like any of the matched contractors?
We'll provide additional matches at no extra cost until you find the right fit. If we can't find suitable contractors in our network, we can vet and onboard new contractors who meet your specific needs.

### Can I use my own contractor through your platform?
Yes, we can onboard your preferred contractor after they pass our complete vetting process. This typically takes 3-5 business days and ensures they meet our insurance and quality standards.

### How many contractors will I be matched with?
Typically 3-5 contractors, but we can provide more options if requested. We focus on quality matches rather than quantity, ensuring each contractor is genuinely suited for your specific project type and budget.

### Do you have contractors for all types of projects?
Yes, our network includes specialists for kitchen renovations, bathroom remodels, whole house renovations, additions, flooring, electrical, plumbing, roofing, painting, and landscaping. We also have contractors who handle historic renovations and luxury custom work.

## Project Process

### How long does the matching process take?
Most matches are completed within 48 hours of submission. Complex projects or those requiring specialized contractors may take up to 72 hours. We prioritize finding the right match over speed.

### What happens after I choose a contractor?
We facilitate contract signing, establish payment milestones, set up communication channels through our platform, schedule the project start date, and begin active project monitoring. Your dedicated project manager will coordinate all aspects of the project timeline.

### How long do renovation projects typically take?
Timeline varies by project scope:
- Bathroom renovation: 2-3 weeks
- Kitchen renovation: 4-8 weeks
- Whole house renovation: 3-6 months
- Home additions: 4-8 months
These are typical ranges; your specific timeline will be established during contractor consultations.

### Can I make changes during the project?
Yes, change orders can be submitted through our platform. All changes require approval from both you and the contractor, with clear documentation of cost and timeline impacts. We help negotiate fair pricing for any modifications.

### How do you handle project delays?
We monitor timelines closely and intervene when delays occur. Contractors must provide updated schedules and explanations for any delays. We work to minimize impacts and ensure delays are justified and unavoidable.

### What if I need to pause my project?
Projects can be paused with proper notice to contractors. We help negotiate pause terms, protect materials, and coordinate restart timing. Extended pauses may require renegotiation of pricing and timeline.

## Communication & Updates

### How often will I receive project updates?
You'll receive weekly updates at minimum, with photo documentation and progress reports through our platform. Daily updates are provided during critical phases like demolition and major installations.

### Can I communicate directly with my contractor?
Yes, our platform includes integrated messaging, but you can also communicate directly via phone or email. We encourage open communication while keeping records of important decisions on our platform.

### Who do I contact if there's an issue?
Your dedicated project advisor is available via platform messaging, email, or phone during business hours. They handle all issue resolution and contractor coordination.

### Do you provide evening or weekend support?
Emergency support for urgent issues (water leaks, electrical problems, security concerns) is available 24/7. Regular support and project questions are handled Monday-Friday 8am-6pm PST.

### How do I know if my project is on track?
Our platform provides real-time timeline tracking, milestone completion status, and budget tracking. You'll receive immediate notifications if anything falls behind schedule or if issues arise.

## Quality & Guarantees

### What guarantees do you offer?
We provide a 100% money-back guarantee on our service fee if you're unsatisfied with our service, plus a 1-year workmanship warranty on all completed projects. If issues arise during the warranty period, we coordinate resolution at no cost to you.

### What if the work quality is poor?
We'll work with the contractor to fix issues immediately. If problems can't be resolved satisfactorily, we'll bring in another contractor to complete or repair the work at no additional platform fee to you.

### How do you ensure project quality?
Through milestone inspections, photo documentation requirements, adherence to building codes, material quality verification, and final walkthrough approvals before payment release. We catch issues early when they're easier and less expensive to fix.

### What if the contractor damages my property?
All contractors carry comprehensive insurance. We facilitate the claims process and ensure proper resolution. In extreme cases, we'll advance funds for immediate repairs while insurance claims are processed.

### What happens if a contractor abandons the project?
We'll immediately source a replacement contractor from our network and cover any additional platform fees for the transition. We also help recover any payments made and ensure project continuity.

### How do you handle disputes between me and the contractor?
We provide mediation services to resolve disputes fairly. Our project managers are trained in conflict resolution and work to find solutions that satisfy both parties. Serious disputes may involve bringing in neutral third-party arbitrators.

## Payments & Financing

### How do contractor payments work?
Payments follow agreed milestones typically structured as: 10% deposit, 25% at project start, 25% at 50% completion, 25% at substantial completion, and 15% final payment. We recommend using our escrow service for protection.

### Do you offer financing options?
We partner with several renovation financing companies including LightStream, Upgrade, and local credit unions. We can connect you with pre-approved financing options based on your creditworthiness and project scope.

### Can I pay with credit card?
Yes, though some contractors may charge a 2-3% processing fee for credit card payments. Many of our clients use rewards credit cards for the deposit and milestone payments to earn points.

### What if I'm unhappy with completed work?
Payment is only released after your approval at each milestone. We mediate any disputes before final payment is made. No money changes hands until you're satisfied with the work completed.

### Are deposits required?
Most contractors require 10-25% deposit to order materials and schedule work. We strongly recommend using our escrow service to hold deposits securely until work begins.

### How does the escrow service work?
You deposit milestone payments into our secure escrow account. Funds are only released to contractors after you approve completed work at each milestone. This protects you from paying for incomplete or unsatisfactory work.

## Project Types & Scope

We handle all residential renovation projects including kitchens, bathrooms, whole house renovations, room additions, flooring installation, electrical upgrades, plumbing improvements, roofing, exterior painting, interior painting, landscaping, and specialty projects like wine cellars or home theaters.

We typically work with projects $25,000 and above. For smaller projects under $25,000, we may recommend contractors directly but without full project management services.

Many contractors in our network offer design services, or we can recommend trusted design partners. We also help coordinate between architects, designers, and contractors to ensure cohesive project execution.

### What about HOA requirements?
We verify HOA requirements during project planning and ensure contractors comply with all community guidelines. We can help prepare HOA submissions and attend HOA meetings if required.

You'll receive a review request after project completion. Reviews help other homeowners make informed decisions and help us maintain quality standards in our contractor network.
